# **.code** - A set of VS Code extensions pack for developers made during DEVSOC'21

## What is this project about?

We have built a few VS Code extensions during this hackathon process. It is still not published in the extension store. The README.md file of the repo has the installation guide on how you can try out these extensions. We are not pro-developers. Hence we faced a lot of issues in writing production level code.

## Which Extensions does **.code** include?

-    **gitignore generator** -> an extension that generates .gitignore file in your repository on the selection of appropriate tech stack.

> Installation Guide: [Readme.md](https://github.com/riteshsp2000/devsoc/blob/master/gitignore-generator/README.md)

-    **spotificode** -> an extension that launches a Chrome/Chromium browser to the 4 popular music sites and you can control the playback from within your Visual Studio Code editor.

> Installation Guide: [Readme.md](https://github.com/riteshsp2000/devsoc/blob/master/spotificode/Readme.md)

-    **postman client** - an extension that sends http/https API request using any of the methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD and OPTIONS with option of post body as Text, Json, Xml, Form Data and Form-Url-Encoded.

> Installation Guide: [Readme.md](https://github.com/riteshsp2000/devsoc/blob/master/Postman-client/README.md)

-    **dbd** - an extension that helps you visualise database schemas. The extension redirects to the browser with the database visualisation.

## What problems we faced?

-    We are a bunch of frontend developers who had no prior knowledge about APIs and backend stuff.
-    This is the first time we are making a VS Code Extension.
-    None of us had knowledge about Typescript and it's advanced features.
-    We also faced a lot of runtime errors due to which we were not able to deploy the extension to the Visual Studio Marketplace

## Technlogies we used in **.code**

-    React
-    Typescript
-    Webview API
-    Material UI
-    Axios

## Future Plans: ðŸ“†

We have a bunch of ideas planned for the future. Following is a list of potential ideas.

-    To solve all the runtime errors
-    To deploy the extensions to Visual Studio Marketplace using Azure
