# **spotificode**

## How to install this extension?

- `cd spotificode`
- run `npm install`
- Open `src/extension.ts` and press F5 / start debugging in the VS Code extension development environment
- This should open a new VS Code window
- There is a little button labelled `Launch ðŸš€` on the bottom right corner in VS Code. This button would bring up a Chrome or Chromium browser (I haven't test it with Chromium yet, I'm not sure if it would work).
  > Note that, Chrome/Chromium needs to be installed first
- You will see a `PICK` button on the bottom right in the browser. You have to click it to let the extension know which tab that you want to control. By clicking it, you will see the playback control buttons show up in VS Code along with the tab title.
